# BudGitz
Financial planning simplified. Easily create budgets for your personal project or expenses.

This repo is the front-end client, built in React.  You can see the app live at [https://budgitz-client.ozharb.vercel.app/]

The app is meant for mobile use, but will still scale for desktop viewing.

To check out the app, I suggest you create a dummy account so you can see the onboarding experience.  But if you just want to view what the program looks like, you can use the demo account.

## Introduction

The key to financial well-being is organization. BudGitz provides you with a quick and simple interface to breakdown big costs into small purchases to encourage thoughtful spending and creative planning. Use the app's intuitive features to edit purchases before you make them.
